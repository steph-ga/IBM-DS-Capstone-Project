# IBM-DS-Capstone-Project
This contains all the work for the IBM Data Science certification.

The ibm_capstone.py is a testing file.
The capstone_project.ipynb contains work for the initial few weeks on cluster neighbourhoods in Toronto.

For work for the final two weeks of the capstone project, please refer to explore_london.ipynb for project description; and explore_london_analysis.ipynb for the main analysis (including wording in project description, results, discussion and conclusion). The analysis file also highlights scope for further work.
